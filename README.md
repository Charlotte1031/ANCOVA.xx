# Statistical Analysis Functions and Demo

This repository contains a suite of R functions designed to perform essential statistical analyses, including ANOVA, ANCOVA, and regression analyses, along with accompanying visualization functions. A detailed demo vignette is also provided to illustrate the application of these functions in various scenarios.

## Overview

The repository offers statistical analysis functions with plotting capabilities for each model type. The available functions allow users to perform and visualize:
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
- Simple and multiple linear regression analyses

Each function includes a plotting feature to facilitate the visualization of results, aiding in the interpretation of statistical findings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Charlotte1031/ANCOVA.git
   ```
2.	Load the functions in your R environment:

  ```bash
  source("path/to/ancova_function.R")
  source("path/to/ancova_plot_function.R")
  source("path/to/anova_function.R")
  source("path/to/anova_plot_function.R")
  source("path/to/regression_function.R")
  ```


## Functions

### ANOVA Functions

- anova_function.R: Performs ANOVA analysis on a given dataset, testing for significant differences across group means.
- anova_plot_function.R: Visualizes the ANOVA results with options for displaying mean differences and confidence intervals across groups.

### ANCOVA Functions

- ancova_function.R: Executes an ANCOVA analysis, adjusting for covariates while comparing group means.
- ancova_plot_function.R: Provides a plot of ANCOVA results, illustrating adjusted group means and highlighting covariate effects.

### Regression Functions

- regression_function.R: Conducts linear regression analysis, supporting both simple and multiple regression models. It outputs model coefficients, residuals, and other relevant statistics.

## Demo

The repository includes a vignette file Demo.Rmd to walk users through:

1.	Loading datasets.
2.	Executing each of the statistical functions.
3.	Generating and interpreting visualizations.

Run the vignette file in R to follow along with the examples, which highlight real-world applications and provide practical insights.

## Testing

This package includes tests to validate the correctness of all functions. Comparisons are made against results from Râ€™s built-in functions (e.g., aov(), lm()) using all.equal() for accuracy and bench::mark() for efficiency. Detailed test results and vignettes are available within the package.

### Example usage:

```r
# ANOVA example
result_anova <- anova_function(data)
anova_plot_function(result_anova)

# ANCOVA example
result_ancova <- ancova_function(data, covariate)
ancova_plot_function(result_ancova)

# Regression example
result_reg <- regression_function(data)
```
