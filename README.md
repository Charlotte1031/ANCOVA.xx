# ANCOVA.xx

This repository contains a suite of R functions designed to perform essential statistical analyses, including ANOVA, ANCOVA, and regression analyses, along with accompanying visualization functions. A detailed demo vignette is also provided to illustrate the application of these functions in various scenarios.

## Overview

The repository offers statistical analysis functions with plotting capabilities for each model type. The available functions allow users to perform and visualize:
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
- Simple and multiple linear regression analyses

Each function includes a plotting feature to facilitate the visualization of results, aiding in the interpretation of statistical findings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Charlotte1031/ANCOVA.xx.git
   ```
2.	Load the functions in your R environment:

  ```bash
  source("path/to/ancova_function.R")
  source("path/to/ancova_plot_function.R")
  source("path/to/anova_function.R")
  source("path/to/anova_plot_function.R")
  source("path/to/regression_function.R")
  ```


## Functions

### ANOVA Functions

- anova_function.R: Performs ANOVA analysis on a given dataset, testing for significant differences across group means.
- anova_plot_function.R: Visualizes the ANOVA results with options for displaying mean differences and confidence intervals across groups.

### ANCOVA Functions

- ancova_function.R: Executes an ANCOVA analysis, adjusting for covariates while comparing group means.
- ancova_plot_function.R: Provides a plot of ANCOVA results, illustrating adjusted group means and highlighting covariate effects.

### Regression Functions

- regression_function.R: Conducts linear regression analysis, supporting both simple and multiple regression models. It outputs model coefficients, residuals, and other relevant statistics.

## Demo

The repository includes a vignette file Demo.Rmd to walk users through:

1.	Loading datasets.
2.	Executing each of the statistical functions.
3.	Generating and interpreting visualizations.

Run the vignette file in R to follow along with the examples, which highlight real-world applications and provide practical insights.

## Testing

This package includes tests to validate the correctness of all functions. Comparisons are made against results from Râ€™s built-in functions (e.g., aov(), lm()) using all.equal() for accuracy and bench::mark() for efficiency. Detailed test results and vignettes are available within the package.

### Example usage:

```r
# Load package
library(ANCOVA.xx)

# Load dataset
data(mtcars)

# Step 1: Run Regressions
model1 <- run_regression(mtcars, response = "mpg", predictors = c("wt"))
model2 <- run_regression(mtcars, response = "mpg", predictors = c("wt", "hp"))

# Step 2: Perform ANOVA
anova_results <- compare_anova(models = list(model1, model2))
print("ANOVA Results:")
print(anova_results)

# Step 3: Perform ANCOVA
ancova_results <- compare_ancova(models = list(model1, model2), covariates = c("wt", "hp"), data = mtcars)
print("ANCOVA Results:")
print(ancova_results)

# Step 4: Visualize ANOVA Results
plot_anova(model1, data = mtcars, response = "mpg", predictor = "wt")

# Step 5: Visualize ANCOVA Results
plot_ancova(model2, data = mtcars, response = "mpg", predictor = "wt", covariate = "hp")
```
